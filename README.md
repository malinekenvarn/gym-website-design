# gym-website-design
A project for the first design course during the web developer program at Mid Sweden university

The purpose of this project was to apply the knowledge in HTML and CSS from the course Web Development I at Mid Sweden University. What was to be done was a commercial website for a company. In this project, I invented a fictve company: a gym brand. The target audience was analyzed by studying 4 large gym chains and what their websites say about the target audience. From those observations, I skissed layout, choose a graphic profile and collected images at Unsplash.com. The result of the project is only design and there is no functionality regarding login and forms.

The designers that made the photos are:
